add spring security dependency added to the pom.xml.
Once spring boot loads, it checks the jars available in the classpath, so if spring security jars are
available then it will auto configures the spring security and places a passowrd in the logs.

with that password we can access the rest api.
i.e. now the rest api is secured with spring security.

defualt username is user.

While sending the request to rest api from postman, pls give authentication info of the api.
Then only it will give the response, otherwise it will give a error as unauthorized.


If u want to configure custom username and password, please give the following properites in application.properties

after 2.0.0 version

spring.security.user.name=gangadhar
spring.security.user.password=nani

before 2.0.0 version

security.user.name=gangadhar
security.user.password=nani
